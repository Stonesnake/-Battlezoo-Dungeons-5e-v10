Your Constitution score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Determining an awakened dungeon’s age depends on when one believes a dungeon is truly “born.” If you mark the beginning of a dungeon’s life from the date when its foundations were first laid, many dungeons are centuries or millennia old. On the other hand, the avatar of even the most ancient dungeon might be only a few weeks old. In either case, awakened dungeons generally manifest avatars who appear to be fully grown members of their race—though they might appear to be young adults, venerable elders, or anywhere in between.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Dungeons can be of any alignment, and their alignment is usually completely unrelated to the alignment of any monsters within the dungeon. If they obtained their life force and spirit from another creature, they often have an alignment similar to that creature. This is especially true if they unlock more of their previous self by clearing floors.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Though an awakened dungeon’s true self might encompass hundreds of thousands of square feet, their avatar appears to be a normal member of their race.

You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Avatar</strong></em>. While you are actually an awakened dungeon, you have manifested an avatar, a unique physical body that appears to be a member of a humanoid race. This avatar is formed of your dungeon core and imbued with your life force and spirit, causing it to be as real as anyone else’s body. If your avatar dies, you die, and so on. Despite your appearance, you gain none of the racial traits of your avatar’s form. However, unless others have some reason to suspect you are not what you appear to be, they assume you are a normal member of that race, and you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to conceal your true nature.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Enter the Dungeon</strong></em>. You and your allies can enter the extradimensional dungeon that is your true form, in a process that takes an hour, attempting to challenge one of the floors and gain special rewards.

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice (usually one language normally spoken by your avatar’s race).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Subraces</strong></em>.
